<h1>Styling Methods</h1>

  <h3>Inline Styling</h3>
   <p>It is possible to style each HTML element with inline styling. For example, 

<div>
  <code> &lt[element name] STYLE="[CSS property]:[property value]"&gt </code>
</div>

  <p>However, this is not always the best approach. In order to make changes, one would have to go through the entire HTML markup and change the styling for each individual element.</p>

  <p>This approach also does not give allow you to use all the wonders of CSS. A better approach would be to only use inline styling for overriding styling rules on a case-by-case basis. (Or just don't do it. Seriously.)</p>

<h2>Enter CSS!</h2>

  <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allow web developers to separate the design aspects of a web site from the HTML markup.</p>

<p>This is considered a best practice in development, and there are a couple of different approaches.</p>

<h3>Embedded Styling</h3>
  <p>Embedded styling allows the presentation rules to be embedded into the HTML <code>&lthead&gt.</p>
  <p>Notice the "presentation rule" located in the <code> &lthead&gt</code> tag, just under the &lttitle&gt.</code> You'll see the following code, which gives us this great grey background:
  <div id="presentation_rule">
    <code>&ltstyle&gt body{background: #d3d3d3}&lt/style&gt</code>
  </div>
    <p>This method allows you to access to all the wonders of CSS, but it's application is limited to a single HTML page.</p>

<h3>External Style Sheets</h3>
    <p>Extneral style sheets create a cleaner way to approach designing a webpage and also allow you to create consistency in design across multple pages.</p>
    
    <p>In the <code> &lthead&gt</code> tag, following the &/style&gt tag, you'll see the following code:</p>
    <div id="presentation_rule">
      <code>&ltlink rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="intro.css"&gt</code>
    </div>
    <p>This links the HTML file to an external style sheet, intro.css. You'll notice that is where we are defining properties for <code>div, h2</code>, etc. This method gives us access to the full-range of CSS capabilities, as well as creates a clean way for us to apply styling rules across multiple pages.</p>

<h3>Higher Precedence</h3>
    <p>One important thing to consider is the precedence given to these methods. Because specificity matters in how styling is rendered (more on that later), embedded styles have a higher precedence than external styles. So, if there are equivalent rules given, the embedded style will take precedence over the external. Likewise, inline styling will have a higher precedence over embedded styling.</p>

    <h4>Order of precedence, from highest to lowest</h4>
    <div>Inline Styling &gt Embedded Styling &gt External Style Sheet</div>
