Styles for HTML can come from different sources:

	default.html
		Author Stylesheet
			<link>
			@import
		User Stylesheet
			modern web browsers allow users to create their own stylesheet that will be applied to every view
			increase accessibility
		Default Stylesheet (User Agent Styles)
			Default rules that are set by the browser


The Cascade 
	applies a weight to stylesheets to mitigate and assign properties when several rules could apply to a single element

	Author Sheet +++
	User Sheet ++
	Default + 

	*!important can be used by the User Stylesheet to override Authored Stylesheet rules

	user agent style sheets
		IE: iecss.com
		Firefox:
		Chrome:
		Edge:
		Safari:


Ordering
	conflicting rules from the same source

		Conflicting rules coming from the same source: CSS applies the last rule defined

		example:
			body {
				background-color: blue;
			}

			body {
				background-color: black;
			}

		Also applies wHen you use multiple stylesheets

			<link src="style1.css"> (defines body background-color as blue)
			<link src="style2.css"> (defines body background-color as black)
			*style2.css rules will override style1.css when a conflicting rules are present (body background-color will be black)

		 or use @import

		  [style1.css]
		 	@import url("style2.css"); (imports the rule that defines the background-color of body as black)

		 	body{
		 		background-color: blue;
		 	}

		 	(The body background-color will be blue)


Note: Developer tools can be a useful way of tracing how style rules are being applied within the HTML DOM.

CSS Reset
	CSS resets are not required, but can be used to override the default styles from a User Agent stylesheets.
	This allows developers to begin from the same initial style across browsers (which may have different default values).

	Simple Reset
		*{ margin: 0; padding: 0; }

	Things to keep in mind:
		Every CSS rule that is zeroed should be redefined. If a style is not redefined, it could cause issues, and could cause issues for users who use keyboard navigation.
