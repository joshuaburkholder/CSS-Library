<h1>More Selectors</h1>

<p>In addition to the selectors previously mentioned, CSS syntax also offers more complex patterns as selectors.</p>

<h3>Descendant selector</h3>

<div><code>
div p {
  background-color: #aaddaa;
}
</code></div>

<p>This rule will apply to the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag. In this case, it will apply the specified property (color) to <code><p></code> tag anywhere inside a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Descendent selectors are written by simply placing a space between the elements.</p>

<h3>Child selector</h3>

<div><code>
div > p {
  background-color: #aaddaa;
}
</code></div>

<p>The child selector operates in a similar manner, except that it will target only &lt;p&gt; tags that are <span class="italic">direct child</span> of an element (in this case, the &lt;div&gt;). </p>
<p>Child selectors are indicated by the &gt; operator between the elements.</p>

<h3>Attribute selector</h3>

<div><code>
img[alt=logo]{ margin: 2px }
</div></code>

<p>The attribute selector will search for and apply property values to all elements with a given attribute. In the example above.<p>
<p>Attribute selectors are written by placing the targeted attribute in <code>[ ]</code>.</p>

<h3>Psuedo class</h3>

a:visited{
  color: #efefef;
}

<p>CSS syntax also provides 'psuedo class' selectors. These selectors will apply properties to elements in a particular state. For instance, in the code above, the color will be applied to all links that have a 'pseudo-class' of 'visited.'</p>
<p>Psuedo class selectors are written by appending the psuedo class to the element after a colon ( : ) .</p>
